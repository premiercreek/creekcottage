				<h1>Creek Cottage</h1>
					<p>
						Welcome to Creek Cottage, the only backpacker hostel in Queen Charlotte.  We have three private rooms available, with a common cooking area, a log stove and a dining area with views looking onto the water.  We try to limit the number of guests so that everyone is comfortable.</p><br/>
		<p>The hostel is in the grounds of an historical hotel.  There is free car-parking and wifi for all guests.  The hostel is a couple of minutesâ€™ walk from the marina, the laundromat, the ATM and the post office.  There are several small restaurants in the village, also within easy reach.</p>
